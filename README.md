# gifBox

## Instructions

You can just type "make" to make the program.

Then run the program with `./gifBox OUTPUTNAME.mp4`

There is no "make install", you can `cp` both programs to /usr/bin or link them if you want, or just run them locally.

### Limitations

You must run it from command line, you cannot change workspaces (if you use i3). No audio support yet.

Hit ctl+c to end it!
